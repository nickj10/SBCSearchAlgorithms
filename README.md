# SBCSearchAlgorithms

## Description
This is a proposed project from Knowledge Based Systems course from Universitat Ramon Llull - La Salle Barcelona. 
The main objective of this project is to implement two of the search algorithms: A* and CSP. Given a map of roads of
Spain, we will be able to find the shortest path from a given origin to a given destination.


## Requirements

It is important to have Java 11 SDK installed and it is very recommended to use IntelliJ IDEA as IDE, but you are free
to use any IDEA that supports Java projects.

## Installation

1. Download the project.
2. Open your IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Open the project as a new project with existing sources.
4. Select the folder where the project is.
5. The only external library used for this project is gson-2.8.7 (which can be easily added to the libraries or
   dependencies using Maven by searching com.google.code.gson and the version is 2.8.7).

## Execution

The compilation and execution can be done by running the Main class.
